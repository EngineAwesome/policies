# Security overview.

## We protect your data.

All data are written to disks instantly and backed up daily. Files that our customers upload are stored on servers that use modern techniques to remove bottlenecks and points of failure.

## Your data is sent using HTTPS.

Whenever your data are in transit between you and us, everything is encrypted, and sent using HTTPS.

## Regularly-updated infrastructure.

Our software infrastructure is updated regularly with the latest security patches. While perfect security is a moving target, we work with security researchers to keep up with the state-of-the-art in web security.

## We protect your billing information.

All credit card transactions are processed using secure encryption—the same level of encryption used by leading banks. Card information is transmitted, stored, and processed securely on a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Payment_Card_Industry_Data_Security_Standard">PCI-Compliant network</a>. Your credit card information is submitted directly to our payment processor and doesn't hit Engine Awesome servers.

## Constant monitoring

We have a team dedicated to maintaining your account’s security on our systems and monitoring tools we’ve set up to alert us to any nefarious activity against our domains. To date, we’ve _never_ had a data breach.

We have processes and defenses in place to keep our streak of 0 data breaches going. But in the unfortunate circumstances someone malicious does successfully mount an attack, we will immediately notify all affected customers.

## Over 20 years of experience.

We’ve been around the block and we’ve seen a lot of companies come and go. Security isn’t just about technology, it’s about trust. We’ll continue to work hard every day to maintain that trust. Longevity and stability is core to our mission at Engine Awesome.
