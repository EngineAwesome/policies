# Who owns a Engine Awesome account?

Engine Awesome accounts are owned by individuals, not by organizations. When you sign up and create an account at Engine Awesome, you are the owner of that account and all the data in it. Our legal responsibility is to the account owner(s), so we won’t let other people take over your account without your permission.

## What can account owners do?

Account owners can:

- **Access and export all data in an account**: account owners can add themselves to any Team and view everything in the account.
- **Manage all aspects of the account's subscription:** including updating billing information; adding more users and account administrators; and cancelling an account.
- **Designate other account administrators**: Engine Awesome accounts can have one owner, but multiple administrators. We recommend designating other administrators you trust, so that updates can be made to the account when you're not available.

## What happens when none of the current account owners are available?

It happens — people switch jobs, get laid off, go on extended leave — the account owner(s) may be unavailable for any number of reasons. Still, our obligation is to the current account owner(s). That means we’re unable to add new owners to the account without permission from a current account owner, communicated from the email address we have on file.

If the account has been frozen due to non-payment for less than a week, we’ll be glad to thaw the account for a week or so, so people can access their work in the meantime.

The quickest route to add a new owner is often to contact a current account owner, and ask them to log in and add another owner right away from the Adminland section.

Otherwise, we can also gladly reach out to any current account owners at the email addresses we have on file, and request permission to add an owner. If it’s a company address and another employee has access to the inbox, the person who receives the email can grant permission to add a new owner. For security’s sake, permission must come from an address we have on file for a current account owner.

When none of the above is an option, a court order is required to add another owner to the account. We will of course readily comply with any court orders to turn data over to the appropriate party.

## What if I have another question about ownership?

Basecamp may update this policy once in a blue moon — we’ll notify you about significant changes by emailing the account owner or by placing a prominent notice on our site. You can access, change or delete your personal information at any time by contacting Basecamp [support][support].
