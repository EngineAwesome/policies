# Reasonable Use Policy

*Last updated: April 15, 2023*

Hello there, and welcome to Engine Awesome! We're all about making your experience as enjoyable and hassle-free as possible, which is why we often use the term "unlimited" when describing our services. However, in the real world, we know that nothing is truly unlimited. It's a bit like an all-you-can-eat buffet - sure, the food seems endless, but there's always a limit to how much one can actually consume. Similarly, in order to maintain a high level of performance and quality for all our users, we have to set some boundaries. That's where our Reasonable Use Policy comes into play.

## We're flexible
Now, we understand that things change, and sometimes you might need a little extra wiggle room. Our limits aren't set in stone â€“ we're all about flexibility and finding solutions that work for you. If you find yourself needing more resources, just reach out to our friendly support team. We'll be more than happy to discuss your requirements and work together to find an accommodation that suits your needs.

## 1. Users: Sharing is Caring, But Not Unlimited

We love to see your team grow, but we have to keep it manageable for everyone. That's why we're setting a limit of 1,000 users per account. This way, we can guarantee that our services run smoothly for all our customers, without sacrificing performance or reliability. Remember, it's all about quality over quantity!

## 2. Records: Keeping It Organized and Efficient

With great power comes great responsibility, and managing data is no exception. In order to maintain a high-performance environment, we limit the number of records per team to 50,000. This ensures that your data stays organized and accessible, without overwhelming the system. Let's keep things neat and tidy!

## 3. Storage: Room to Grow, Within Reason

We know that your data storage needs may change over time, but to keep things running smoothly, we're setting a cap of 5GB per account. It might sound like a small number, but trust us, it's more than enough for most teams. By setting this limit, we can make sure that everyone enjoys a consistent experience with our services.

## 4. Object Types: Variety is the Spice of Life, to a Point

We encourage you to explore the versatility of our platform, but let's not get too carried away. In order to maintain a balanced and efficient system, we're limiting the number of object types to 50 per account. This allows for plenty of creativity and customization without bogging down the system.

Now, with these rules in place, we're all set to create some amazing applications together! If you ever have any questions or concerns, don't hesitate to reach out to our [support team](https://engineawesome.com/support/). We're always here to help.

Thanks again for choosing Engine Awesome, and let's build something incredible together!
